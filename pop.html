<h1><u><center>Pop</center></u></h1>
<p>We could say that any genre gaining massive popularity becomes pop music. As an example, The Beatles were pop, although, from a genre point of view, they produced mainly soft rock tracks.</p>
<p>Throughout the Eighties, pop music evolved towards more electronic sounds, with artists and songs bridging the gap between the classic rock form (deriving from the Blues) and modern approaches to music that led us directly to the digital era.<p>
<p>Nowadays, pop music takes much of its sounds and musical language from the world of hip-hop, with its sub-genres of trap and rap being extremely popular. Electronic and dance elements are still very present in the mainstream, with other influences, such as Latin sounds, often joining in to create a diverse and eclectic approach.</p>
