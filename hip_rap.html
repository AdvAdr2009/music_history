<h2 id="h20"><center>Hip-Hop</center></h2>
<p>These two genres, originating in the Eighties but with some ancient roots planted in the Blues and the Gospel too, presented an incredible evolution that made them a sort of standard for the mainstream.</p>
<p>The encounter between spoken words and electronic sounds made music doable without the traditional tools, like a good singing voice or the ability to play an instrument. Through sharp rhymes and rough sounds, the first rappers narrated the harshness of life in the ghetto, while right now, their descendants are experiencing some great success.</p>
<p>Many hip-hop sub-genres, such as rap and trap, are now filling the charts and influencing many other popular genres. The trends evolve at a very rapid pace, thanks to social media and the internet.</p>
