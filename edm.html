<h1><center><u>Dance/Electronic Music</u></center></h1>
<p>The rise of computers and digital technology allowed producers to explore new ways to make music. We no longer need a musical instrument to write or produce a song. We just need a computer.</p>
<p>This is how electronic music rose to fame throughout the Eighties and the Nineties, with some precedents in the Seventies, when orchestras, however, were still very popular in dance halls.</p>
